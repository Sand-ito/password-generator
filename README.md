# password-generator

Hello. My name is Josh. Welcome to my password generator. Most of the magic of my website is in the script.js file. In the file, there are two functions. The main function takes in all the criteria the user desires and turns it into a random password. The other function puts the newly generated password into the HTML file so the user can see it and copy it.

[Here is a link to my deployed website, check it out!](https://sand-ito.github.io/password-generator/)

I would say that there were two main struggles when it came to creating this project. The first was overthinking my script before I even started to make it. I started with making a chart. As I was making it I realized, I was trying to sculpt a miricle code that did everything in one line. I learned that sometimes the best thing you can do is just start and try to accomplish the first small step and build off of it. 

The second challenge I faced was extracting random characters from my variable I pushed all of my "character type" arrays into. By putting multiple arrays inside a main array, I learned that I had created a "multidimensional array". In order to pull a single character from a multidimensional array, I first had to pick one of the arrays within it at random. Then I picked a random character from the array that was selected. I created a loop to repeat this process to the user's initail prompt of how long they would like their password to be. I put all of the randomly selected characters in a blank variable, and assigned it to be displayed for the user to access.

Overall I am proud of the outcome. Thank you for taking your time to interact and look at my website!
